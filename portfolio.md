As a theater critic and founder of JaxPlays, I’ve chronicled Northeast Florida’s stage scene with a mission to preserve its past, promote its present and propel its future. Beyond the limelight, I’ve reported on everything from breaking news and city politics to arts, culture and technology, sharing stories through broadcast, print, digital and podcasts.

This portfolio brings together broadcast clips, selected reviews and features, and reporting highlights.

What you’ll find:
- **Broadcast clips** from *First Coast Connect* and *River City Live* with embedded videos
- **Reviews and features** chosen for range and readability — titles link to originals
- **Additional work** from *Deemable Tech* and **WJCT News 89.9**, grouped to show creative storytelling, breaking news, in-depth features and evergreen guides

This is a curated selection, not a complete list. Full archives are linked at the end of the page.
