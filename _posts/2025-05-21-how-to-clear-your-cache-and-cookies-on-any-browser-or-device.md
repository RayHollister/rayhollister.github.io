Clearing your cache and cookies can fix website issues, protect your privacy and speed up your device. If you're developing a website or making updates to one, clearing your cache is especially important. Changes often won’t appear on your device unless you clear cached files that are storing outdated versions of the site.

Whether you're using a computer, phone or tablet, here’s how to clear your cache and cookies in every major browser.

## What Are Cache and Cookies?

- **Cache**: Temporary files stored by your browser to help websites load faster.
- **Cookies**: Small files websites use to remember your preferences, logins and activity.

Over time, these files can build up, cause errors or display outdated content. Here's how to clear them.
